# Recipe: Thumbnail

The output whose only job is to **earn the click at tiny scale** — a YouTube thumbnail, a blog/article
hero, a LinkedIn/Open-Graph link-preview card. It is read at ~160px wide in a noisy feed, so it is the
*most* contrast- and hierarchy-disciplined thing the kit makes.

**Compose it as:** this recipe × a style template (usually `statement` for a hook, `stat` for a number)
× a format. Pull tokens from the project's top-level `DESIGN.md`.

## Recoup article pipeline

An article thumbnail requires a large text hook and one bold focal illustration. Any approved Recoup
background color is valid; blue is not required. Choose contrasting text and artwork for the selected
field (for example white/lime on forest, forest on lime, or dark ink on white). Generate artwork with
Higgsfield, then add exact editable DM Sans text. The generated background alone is not the final
thumbnail. Supporting article figures use pure white backgrounds, minimal labels and optional
headlines. Omit repeated wordmarks. Keep thumbnail and inline compositions distinct.

## Format
- **YouTube / video:** 1280×720 (16:9).
- **Link / OG preview** (LinkedIn, X, blog share): 1200×630 (1.91:1).
- **In-feed thumbnail:** 1080×1350 (4:5) or 1080×1080.
- Exact specs + safe zones: `references/dimensions.md`.

> **Animated hero?** This still image stays the **poster + OG image** (link-preview cards never animate). To add
> motion *on the owned blog*, mount a muted `<video>` loop behind it — drop-in template
> `library/web/blog-hero.html`, render the loop with `consulting-hyperframes-video`. Playbook:
> `knowledge/sops/animated-media-for-posts-and-article-headers.md`.

## The craft bar (what makes it good)
1. **One 3–6 word hook, enormous.** The words *are* the design — they should fill roughly a third to a
   half of the frame. If it needs a sentence, it's a `statement` post, not a thumbnail.
2. **One high-contrast focal element.** A face mid-emotion, a single number, or one object/diagram — never
   a scene. The eye must land in <1 second.
3. **Maximum contrast.** Choose a field from the current approved Recoup palette, with
   text and illustration colors that clearly contrast against it. No pale gradients, no mid-tones fighting the text.
4. **No body copy.** No paragraphs, no captions, no multi-line subheads. Supporting text (if any) is one
   short kicker.
5. **Footer is optional.** Thumbnails often drop the footer to maximize focal size — keep just the Recoup
   mark in a corner if it fits without crowding; otherwise omit.

## Composition pattern
Asymmetric: hook anchored to one side (or top/bottom third), focal element balancing the opposite weight.
Generous margins. The single `--signal` accent points the eye to the word/number that matters.

## The 160px test (non-negotiable)
Shrink the render to ~160px wide (or squint). If the hook isn't instantly legible and the focal element
isn't obvious, it fails — increase type size and contrast, cut elements, try again.

## Avoid (the tells)
Multiple ideas · paragraphs of text · low contrast · tiny type · a busy scene · 4+ colors · generic stock.

## Render
Render at the target size. Preserve the workspace or existing bundle's delivery format.
For a WebP bundle, render a temporary PNG in the dated work folder, encode the final WebP,
and inspect its text and edges at full size and 160px. Update references and source manifests
together; do not leave duplicate PNG delivery files. Retain editable HTML and selected artwork.

Example PNG intermediate (use WebP conversion afterward when required):
```bash
npx playwright screenshot --viewport-size="1280,720" "file:///abs/path/thumb.html" "/abs/path/thumb.png"
```

## Quality checklist
- [ ] Hook ≤6 words and is by far the biggest element
- [ ] One clear focal element; eye lands in <1s
- [ ] Committed field + one `--signal` pop; AA contrast on the hook
- [ ] No body copy; ≤1 short kicker
- [ ] Passes the 160px / squint test
- [ ] On-brand type + palette from `DESIGN.md`

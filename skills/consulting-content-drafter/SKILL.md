# Consulting Content Drafter

**Workspace:** use the selected project and its `AGENTS.md`; keep existing entity folders and
Reality headings. Business paths below are relative to that project. Bundled resources are relative
to this installed skill; sibling capabilities resolve by their installed names. Never search another
private checkout for missing inputs. Use workspace identity, audience, pricing, and `DESIGN.md` fonts.

## Steps
1. Take the signal (from `signals/`) — read its `source`/`related` and traverse to the raw for context.
2. **Ground research-derived drafts (pull the wiki).** If the idea cites `[[wiki pages]]` (it came
   from `consulting-research-miner`) or the topic is agent/skill/AI-engineering-shaped, follow
   `integrations/research/AGENTS.md` to read the relevant *whole* wiki pages (incl. `## What we'd
   steal`) and pull concrete, cited specifics to build the draft on — carry the `[[citations]]` so
   every claim stays traceable. Out-of-domain topic? Skip this — the wiki is silent on generic
   app/business, so don't force it.
3. Write a title with a clear subject and takeaway. A reader seeing only the title must understand what the article covers and what they will learn. Name the actual work or decision; replace vague references such as "the tool," "two numbers," or "the system" with concrete context. Match the promise to the article evidence. Never invent a count, percentage or outcome to fit a headline formula. Curiosity comes after comprehension.
4. Structure with AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action). Lead with the problem + outcome, not your resume.
5. Place it on the specificity ladder (generic → category → specific → targeted) and match it to the business stage.
6. Convert the topic to a lowercase hyphenated slug, removing path separators and punctuation. Save the draft in `content/03-drafts/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>/`; note the target audience (IC vs. leadership).
7. Run the intended-reader review and `consulting-copy-editor` gates; implement accepted edits before generating article assets.
8. Preserve the workspace or bundle's image delivery format, including existing WebP paths.
   For an illustrated article or complete bundle, invoke `consulting-article-illustrator`:
   a bold thumbnail with a large text hook and contrasting artwork on any approved Recoup color,
   followed by simple pure-white-background inline illustrations with minimal labels and optional
   headlines. Use Higgsfield artwork with editable DM Sans overlays via `consulting-graphics`.
   Do not force images onto a text-only post. Keep assets and their sources in the same bundle.

Output: a draft ready for review. Sources: Ch. 5 + (for agent/skill topics) the research wiki via `integrations/research/AGENTS.md`.
